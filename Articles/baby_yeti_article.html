											<h3>Just missing googly eyes</h3>
                                            
                                            <p>
											<strong>Overview</strong> 
											<br />
                                            This project was for my senior design class. For anyone not knowledgable in the ways of senior design, it is a two-part
											class which takes groups of students along the engineering design process. 
											<br />
											<br />
                                            My group went with a small robot which would be a software testing platform. More specifically, a software testing platform
                                            for the Intelligent Systems Club's autonomous snowplow team "Yeti"; now known as "Mammoth". I talk about the Yeti 
                                            project <a href="yeti_article.html"><span>Here</span></a>. This project solves an issue that the team was having, where they did
											not have enough testing time leading up to the 2020 competition. The testbench provides a tool for the software team to work with when the mechanical 
											and electrical teams have the Yeti robot in pieces. The testbench also provides a way for new members of the ISC to experiment with their code outside 
											of Gazebo and the likes. 
											<br />
											<br />
											<strong>Planning, Constraints, and Requirements</strong> 
											<br />
											The first semester allowed us time to work through what we would want to deliver. For this semester we would have to develop a concept, requitrements, 
											high level design, and start with excusrions. After pitching the concept, the requirements took a while to develop. 
											<br />
											<br />
											The constraints were based off what our idea of the robot would be. (An indoor test bench small enough to be easily moved in case a member needed to take 
											the equipment to a new space for testing)
											<br />
											<br />
											Some of the requirements were based off hardware which was required to be used by the club. We would be borrowing the LiDAR and camera from the club, 
											so while the idea of planning requirements based on a design elements is not ideal, we planned the rest of the requirements off of what the club would find most 
											attractive in a test bench robot. 
											<br />
											<br />Some of the requirements we had:
											<br />-Under 1 cubic foot 
											<br />-Operate with on-board power supply for 1 hour 
											<br />-Stop time after no controller input under 1.5 seconds 
											<br />-Max speed under 1 m/s
											<br />-PI reaches stead ystate under 1.5 seconds 
											<br />-LiDAR range 0.1 meter to 10 meters 
											<br />-Laser scan data rate for the LiDAR cannot exceed 1 Mbps
											<br />-Pose data rate for the camera under 0.5 Mbps
											<br />
											<br />
											Two planning elemts of the second semster are build schedule and test plan. I suppose that is planning too. The build schedule was crated at the end of the low 
											level design process. The schedule was made to spread out the difficult and easier sections of work. It also accounted for taking care of essential sections early 
											so every member would have something to work on as the build progressed. The test plan was designed based on the requirements where each requirement needed to be 
											tested to prove the system was succesful. We had rougly 12 weeks to complete the build and testing of the robot.
											<br />
											<br />
											<strong>Design</strong> 
											<br />
											The High level design was completed in the first semester. We broke the projects into submodules and then identified the major components that would be needed for each 
											of these modules. Along with the modules we described a power and data interface. 
											We designed 5 modules:
											<br />
											<br />
											Perception:
											<br />-(hardware) Tracking camera [<em>Intel RealSense T265 - provided by ISC</em>]
											<br />-(software) ROS Camera node 
											<br />-(hardware) LiDAR [<em>UST-10LX - provided by ISC</em>]
											<br />-(software) ROS LiDAR node
											<br />
											Drive:
											<br />-(hardware) Motors with encoders [<em>4x 6V DC - 10 kg-cm 210 rpm w/ encoders</em>] 
											<br />-(hardware) Motorcontroller [<em>sabertooth dual 12A motor driver</em>] 
											<br />-(software) ROS Motorcontroller node
											<br />
											Control:
											<br />-(hardware) Microcontroller [<em>Nvidia Jetson Nano developer kit</em>] 
											<br />-(software) PID control system node
											<br />-(hardware) Handheld controller [<em>Xbox one variant - provided by ISC</em>] 
											<br />-(software) ROS Joy node
											<br />
											Communication:
											<br />-(hardware) Personal computer (<em>one of ours for interacting with SSH</em>) 
											<br />-(hardware) wireless hotspot (<em>a router for wireless</em>)
											<br />-(hardware) Wifi module [<em>Waveshare AC8265 WNIC</em>] 
											<br />
											Power:
											<br />-(hardware) Batteries [<em>Skylipo 7.4V 3300 mAh</em>] 
											<br />-(hardware) Jetson Nano (<em>it provides power to encoders</em>)
											<br />-(hardware) LiDAR voltage regulator [<em>Pololu 12V step-up U3V12F12</em>] 
											<br />-(hardware) Jetson Nano voltage regulator [<em>DFRobot DFR0205 power module</em>]
											<br />
											<br />
											<strong>Implementation</strong> 
											<br />
											Naturally some design elements changed betwen the HLD and LLD and even then to the final build. 
											I will talk more about the final build than the LLD for the implementation.
											<br />
											<br />
											The controller software and the power delivery for the Nano were completed first. Pretty straight foward. This is where we had to 
											start setting up what was left for ubuntu and ros. We setup Catkin workspaces and our github and cloned it into our workspace. We added Isc_Joy 
											as a dependancy, so we were using some prebuilt drivers for the controller. We echoed the topics to check for functionality. While doing this, 
											the default joystick input was actually configured to be my accelorometer for my HP Pavillion laptop. Since we were new to ubuntu, we were quite 
											about what was happening. We figured out to disable the kernel module using blacklist for a few of the built in packages. Then we could see all 
											the controller inputs! <a href="../images/VLSI/hldesign.jpg" ><span>Figure 1</span></a>.
