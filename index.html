												<h2>About me</h2>
											</header>
											<img src="images/download.png" alt="" />
											<h3>Placeholder</h3>
											<p>Hello! I am an engineering student at The University of Michigan - Dearborn. My degree is computer engineering, and I 
											am almost completed with my undergratuate degree. Hopefully I have the time and resources to finish a minor in mathematics 
											along with my major, as math deeply interest me. <br />
											This is my first excursion into anything dealing with websites, so it has been quite an interesting project to work on. I 
											figured this could be a helpful companion to my resume, as I would be able to readily showcase some of my projects in more depth.
											I plan on keeping this up to date with my new projects and accomplishments, and maybe that will help me keep my Linkedin updated 
											as well. <br />
											<br />Outside of school studies, I am the president of the robotics club, the Intelligent Systems Club, at UM Dearborn. The ISC has 
											been a wonderful learning experience for me. It has opened my eyes to the logistics of project managment such as setting up meetings, 
											interacting with advisors, maintaining documentation and training resources, and finding new goals for the members to work towards. 
											The specific team I work on, Mammoth which was previously known as Yeti, has taken me on learning experiences for robotics, electrical 
											engineering, mechanichal engineering, and hopefully soon autonomous software development. The elctrical team, which I am team leader 
											and now sadly the only member, has reinforced ideas such as the need for proper documentation and good practices for electrical 
											harnesses. I have to redo the website for the ISC, and then I will link that here too!<br />
											<br />Besides the ISC to keep me busy, I am fascinated by computer hardware design, aerospace engineering, rocket engineering, art, 
											and reading. All of the photos on the website are mine. If you would like to use any, let me know. With the exception (currently) of those 
											placeholder images ie that one right below here.
